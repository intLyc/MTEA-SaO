# Multitasking Optimization via An Adaptive Solver Multitasking Evolutionary Framework (MTEA-SaO)

**Email: int_lyc@cug.edu.cn**

## New Update

We provide multiobjective version of MTEA-SaO with solvers NSGA-II and SPEA2-DE
The code also included in the [MTO-Platform](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform), The source code of MO-MTEA-SaO can be found at [MO-MTEA-SaO](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform/blob/master/MTO/Algorithms/Multi-objective%20Multi-task/Multi-population/MO-MTEA-SaO/MO_MTEA_SaO.m)

## Note

The provided MTEA_SaO.m file needs to be placed in the Algorithms Folder in  [MTO-Platform](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform) for use.

The [MTO-Platform](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform) has incorporated relevant algorithms and provides convenient functions. We highly recommend using MTO-Platform for code training. [https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform)

The real-world applications covered in the paper have also been uploaded to the MTO-Platform
